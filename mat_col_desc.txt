Column information:
*Timestamps: the upper limit of their associated timestamp (bin), i.e. each row contains values associated measurements/events occuring between the previous and current row's timestamp value.
*T?_LFP_Raw: Raw LFP trace (in voltage)
*T?_LFP_Raw_HilbVals: Hilbert transformed LFP (phase measurements (range +/- pi))
*T?_LFP_Theta: The Theta filtered LFP (in voltage)
*T?_LFP_Theta_HilbVals: Hilbert transformed Theta LFP (phase measurements (range +/- pi))
*T?_LFP_Beta: Beta filtered LFP (in voltage)
*T?_LFP_Beta_HilbVals: Hilbert transformed Beta LFP (phase measurements (range +/- pi))
*T?-U?: binary (0 or 1) indicators of whether there was a spike in that time bin or not for unit? of tetrode?
*Odor?: (1 or 0) trial odor was presented or not
*Position?: (1 or 0) position indicator
*InSeqLog: 1 for InSeq trial, 0 for the rest (nontrials and OutSeq)
*PerformanceLog: 1(correct), -1(incorrect), 0(null event)
*PokeEvents: 1(rat initialy enters the port), -1(rat withdraws from the port), 0(null event)
*XvalRatMazePosition/YvalRatMazePosition: a position value (probably in pixel) or a NaN (position was recorded every 15ms on average, many unrecorded rows)
